                <h2>AI in Road Transport <button onclick="change(0)"> Image 1</button></h2>  
                
                <p>As technology continues to progress, we are seeing industries implement Artificial Intelligence (AI) applications into their systems. 
                    AI associates any machine that acts in a way that seems intelligent or exhibits characteristics that are shown in human reasoning.
                    AI can provide to a problem can be solved by a human however, an AI is able to provide solutions significantly faster.
                    In road transportation we are faced with many issues that impact our day to day lives. Some of these issues include traffic congestion, greenhouse gas emissions, and accidents due to human error. 
                    AI is trying to solve these problems in road transportation in the form of autonomous vehicles which are vehicles such as self-driving cars that operate without human controlling them.                  
                </p>    
                
                <h3>Self Driving cars <button onclick="change(1)"> Image 2</button></h3>
                
                <p>Self-driving car technology is a major talking point when considering AI in transportation as the implementation of this would create a more streamlined travel experience for everyone. Congestion can be a major issue when driving especially in countries such as Bangladesh where traffic jams are an everyday occurrence in their cities.
                Although many of the current problems in Bangladesh are due to their non-standard roads, lack of parking, and broken traffic systems fixing this will not stop congestion in the long term as the human and car population only continues to grow. 
                However, before self-driving cars can be introduced to the cities of Bangladesh most if not all these problems need to be fixed as a good foundation is required for self-driving cars. 
                A good foundation is required as self-driving cars need to use cameras, ultrasonic sensors, GPS, Light Detection and Ranging (LiDAR), and radar as the primary sensors to process information. 
                For the camera and sensor technology to function properly they will need to take in information such as road signs, line markings, and obstacles around the vehicle to determine when to do basic things like changings lanes and adjusting speed. 
                
                <h3>Truck Platooning <button onclick="change(2)"> Image 3</button></h3>  
                <p>Truck platooning is virtually linked autonomous trucks that drive closely behind one another with the leading truck being a human driver. 
                    In terms of functionality the main difference between self-driving cars and trucks is for truck platooning the first truck will need to be able to communicate its actions to the following trucks. 
                    Wireless communication is more than likely required which raises some concerns such as how large the communication frequency should be, how often data is sent between trucks, at higher speeds the frequency may have to shift which can cause communication issues, and other interferences caused by the same frequency band being used.    
                
                </p>
                <p> There are also many problems currently when looking at the implementation of truck platooning such as lane changing as platoons will be two or more trucks long. 
                    Depending on the length of the platoon it can pose a problem of all trucks changing lanes at the same time. 
                    With this mind you can see that even though benefits exist in manpower saving and fuel economy there are still issues surrounding traffic flow that need to be solved first. 
                    The two solutions currently discussed for this are lower lane change frequency and creating or specifying a single lane for the platoon to stay in.
                However, this canâ€™t always solve the problem as what if there are road works or the trucks need to be in a certain lane for a turn. There is currently no set-in stone solution to the traffic flow problem that truck platooning may cause which if not solved can prove to stall the implementation of this technology.
                <h2>Ethics of AI in Transportation <button onclick="change(3)"> Image 4</button></h2>
                <p> When looking at AI in the transportation industry there are many ethical concerns especially surrounding the use of autonomous transportation.
                    Some of guidelines that researchers, manufacturers, and policy makers have been asked to follow are, to prevent unsafe use by having a safe design, define clear standards for responsible on road testing, safeguard private information, allow user choice, and create fair systems for compensating victims of accidents involving autonomous vehicles.
                Some of guidelines that researchers, manufacturers, and policy makers have been asked to follow are, to prevent unsafe use by having a safe design, define clear standards for responsible on road testing, safeguard private information, allow user choice, and create fair systems for compensating victims of accidents involving autonomous vehicles.
                Although these are not all the guidelines there is a consensus of what should be addressed ethically when approaching the development of autonomous vehicles. Safety, privacy, and responsibility are the core aspects addressed ethically for autonomous vehicles and if guidelines such as those mentioned are followed, they should be close to no ethical issues by the time autonomous vehicles are ready. </p>
                </p>
                <h2>Why Should we Use AI in Transportaion? <button onclick="change(4)"> Image 5</button></h2>
                <p> All forms of transportation can be improved through the implementation of AI currently and in the future.
                    In the future technology such as autonomous vehicles express very large benefits in streamlining travel for everyday users, reducing emissions caused by petrol-based transportation, and traffic congestion. However, this technology is still developed and there is still much to figure out before autonomous vehicles can be implemented. Once this technology is ready it will cause a significant positive change in our everyday lives.
